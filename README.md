# BeerXML JSON Schema

This repository contains a JSON schema for the BeerXML standard, converted for ease of use and integration into your projects.

## What is BeerXML?

[BeerXML](https://www.beerxml.com/) is a widely adopted standard for exchanging brewing recipes and related data in the homebrewing and craft brewing communities. It provides a structured format to represent various aspects of a brewing recipe, such as ingredients, equipment, and process details.

## Why JSON Schema?

While BeerXML is typically represented in XML, using a JSON schema allows for easier integration with modern web and software development technologies. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format, and leveraging a JSON schema makes it simple to validate and ensure the correctness of BeerXML data in a JSON format.

## Usage

To integrate the BeerXML JSON schema into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/beerxml-json-schema.git
